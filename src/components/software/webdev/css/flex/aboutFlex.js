      <h2>About the Flex Box Method</h2>

      <p>
        Flexbox is a layout method in CSS that provides a flexible way to
        distribute and align elements within a container. It allows you to
        create responsive and dynamic layouts, making it easier to build complex
        designs without relying heavily on floats or positioning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Flexbox layout is based on two main components: the flex container
        and flex items. The flex container serves as the parent element that
        contains the flex items. By applying a specific set of properties to the
        container, you establish a flex context for its children. These
        properties include <code>display</code>, <code>flex-direction</code>,{" "}
        <code>flex-wrap</code>, <code>justify-content</code>,{" "}
        <code>align-items</code>, and <code>align-content</code>.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>display</strong> property: It is set to <code>flex</code> or{" "}
          <code>inline-flex</code> on the flex container, enabling it to become
          a flex container and activate flexbox behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>flex-direction</strong> property: It determines the direction
          in which flex items are placed within the container. It can be set to{" "}
          <code>row</code>, <code>row-reverse</code>, <code>column</code>, or{" "}
          <code>column-reverse</code>, allowing for horizontal or vertical
          layouts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>flex-wrap</strong> property: It controls whether flex items
          should wrap to the next line if they exceed the width of the
          container. It can be set to <code>nowrap</code>, <code>wrap</code>, or{" "}
          <code>wrap-reverse</code>, influencing the flow of flex items.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>justify-content</strong> property: It defines how flex items
          are aligned along the main axis of the flex container. It offers
          options such as <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>,{" "}
          <code>center</code>, <code>space-between</code>,{" "}
          <code>space-around</code>, and <code>space-evenly</code>, allowing for
          various horizontal alignment options.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>align-items</strong> property: It specifies how flex items are
          aligned along the cross axis of the flex container. It provides
          options like <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>,{" "}
          <code>center</code>, <code>baseline</code>, and <code>stretch</code>,
          enabling vertical alignment control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>align-content</strong> property: It determines the alignment
          of multiple lines of flex items when there is extra space along the
          cross axis. It offers values such as <code>flex-start</code>,{" "}
          <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>space-between</code>
          , <code>space-around</code>, and <code>stretch</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Flex items, on the other hand, are the child elements of the flex
        container. They automatically adjust their size and position based on
        the flexbox rules. Each flex item can have properties like{" "}
        <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>,{" "}
        <code>flex-basis</code>, <code>flex</code>, and <code>align-self</code>.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>flex-grow</strong> property: It specifies how flex items grow
          to occupy available space along the main axis if there is extra space.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>flex-shrink</strong> property: It determines how flex items
          shrink when there is a lack of space along the main axis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>flex-basis</strong> property: It defines the initial size of
          flex items before any remaining space is distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>flex</strong> property: It is a shorthand property that
          combines <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and{" "}
          <code>flex-basis</code> into a single declaration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>align-self</strong> property: It allows you to override the{" "}
          <code>align-items</code> value for an individual flex item, providing
          custom alignment along the cross axis.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        By utilizing the Flexbox method and its associated properties, you can
        create flexible and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen
        sizes and content variations. It offers a powerful and intuitive
        approach to element positioning and alignment,making it a popular choice
        for building modern web designs.
