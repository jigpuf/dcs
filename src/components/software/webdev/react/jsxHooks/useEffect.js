      <h1>UseEffect Hook</h1>
      <p>
        The useEffect hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to
        perform side effects in functional components. Side effects refer to
        operations that have an impact beyond the scope of the component
        rendering, such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, or
        manipulating the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The useEffect hook takes two arguments: a callback function and an
        optional array of dependencies. Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <p>{code}</p>
      <p>
        When the component is rendered, the callback function inside useEffect
        is executed after the component has been rendered to the DOM. This means
        that any state updates or changes to the DOM resulting from the initial
        render will have already been applied. The second argument of useEffect
        is an optional array of dependencies. It is used to specify values that
        the effect depends on. The effect will only be re-run if any of the
        values in the dependency array have changed since the previous render.
        If the dependency array is empty, the effect will only run once, similar
        to the componentDidMount lifecycle method.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some key points to keep in mind when using useEffect:</p>
      <li>
        The effect function can return a cleanup function. This cleanup function
        is executed when the component is unmounted or before the effect is
        re-run due to a dependency change. It's used to clean up any resources
        or subscriptions created by the effect. For example:
      </li>
      <li>
        If the dependency array is omitted, the effect will run after every
        render. This is equivalent to not specifying a dependency array at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the effect does not depend on any values and you want it to run only
        once when the component is mounted, you can pass an empty dependency
        array []. This is equivalent to componentDidMount.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the effect depends on a value that comes from the component's props
        or state, make sure to include that value in the dependency array.
        Otherwise, the effect may not run again when the value changes, and it
        will continue to use the initial value.
      </li>
      <li>
        To prevent unnecessary re-runs of the effect, make sure to specify the
        minimum set of dependencies required for the effect. Avoid including
        values that don't affect the behavior of the effect.
      </li>
      <p>
        The useEffect hook provides a powerful way to handle side effects in
        functional components and is often used as a replacement for lifecycle
        methods in class components. It promotes a more declarative and
        composable approach to managing state and side effects in React
        applications.
