      <h1>Explanation of Null in JavaScript</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>null</strong> is a special value in JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>It represents the intentional absence of any object value.</li>
        <li>
          It is a primitive value that signifies the absence of an object or the
          absence of a valid reference.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Type and Value</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>null</strong> is of type "object" according to the JavaScript
          specification.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, it is considered a primitive value because it is not an
          object itself, but rather a representation of the absence of an
          object.
        </li>
        <li>
          The value of <strong>null</strong> is <strong>null</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>null</strong> is often used to explicitly indicate that a
          variable or property has no assigned value or that an object reference
          is intentionally empty.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is different from <strong>undefined</strong>, which typically
          indicates an uninitialized variable or an absent property.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When a variable or property is assigned the value{" "}
          <strong>null</strong>, it indicates that there is no meaningful object
          or value associated with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>null</strong> is falsy, meaning it evaluates to false in a
          boolean context.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, <strong>null</strong> is not the same as false or an empty
          string; it is a distinct value representing the absence of a value.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Comparison</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When comparing with other values, <strong>null</strong> is equal
          (loose equality with type coercion) only to <strong>null</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>undefined</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is not equal to any other value, including <strong>false</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>0</strong>, or an empty string.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
